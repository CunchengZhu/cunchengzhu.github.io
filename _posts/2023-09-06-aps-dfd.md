I will be presenting at the APS Division of Fluid Dynamics meeting (DFD) in 2023 as a first-time DFDer. 

For a sneak peak into my work, you can view my [abstract on Riemannian active nematics](https://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/DFD23/Session/X01.11).
In addition to presenting, I have the honor to chair a fascinating sesstion -- [Biofluids: Collective Behavior and Active Matter V](https://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/DFD23/Session/ZC07). 

I am looking forward to connecting with my fellow fluid enthusiasts. 
It is a excellent opportunity to share insights, learn from exports and engage in inspiring discussion in the field :ï¼‰

Here is a recording of my presentation in case you missed it.
